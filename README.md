# Convolutional_Neural_Network

Convolutional neural networks, also known as convnets or CNN, is a type of deep-learning model almost universally used in computer vision applications. CNN are distinguished from other neural networks by their superior performance with image, speech, or audio signal inputs. CNNs are made up of neurons that have learnable weights and biases. Each neuron receives some inputs, performs a dot product and optionally follows it with a non-linearity. The whole network still expresses a single differentiable score function: from the raw image pixels on one end to class scores at the other. And they still have a loss function on the last (fully-connected) layer and all the tips/tricks we developed for learning regular Neural Networks still apply. This notebook focuses on the basic concepts of CNN with examples and their application for image processing task.
